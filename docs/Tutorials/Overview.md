# :material-hand-wave: Welcome to the Tutorials
Thanks for using BetonQuest! The plugin has tons of features and therefore requires some learning.
This documentation provides you with a large number of high quality tutorials that will make you a great quest writer.

However, help is not far if you get stuck. We have a
[Discord :fontawesome-brands-discord:](https://discordapp.com/invite/rK6mfHq) for questions.
